# About

This app is intended to be a fully-playable sudoku app. It will auto-generate a board based off selected difficulty, ensuring only a single valid solution exists. The user will then be able to fill in the board, such that each row, column, and 3x3 block contains each number from 1 to 9. The user can fill in each cell with notes of possible candidates. Cells will be automatically highlighted based on the selected cell & number.
